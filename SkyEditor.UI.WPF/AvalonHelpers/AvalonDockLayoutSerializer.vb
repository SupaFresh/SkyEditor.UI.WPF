    ''' <remarks>
    ''' Class implements an attached behavior to load/save a layout for AvalonDock manager.
    ''' This layout defines the position and shape of each document and tool window
    ''' displayed in the application.
    '''
    ''' Load/Save is triggered through command binding
    ''' On application start (AvalonDock.Load event results in LoadLayoutCommand) and
    '''    application shutdown (AvalonDock.Unload event results in SaveLayoutCommand).
    '''
    ''' This implementation of layout save/load is MVVM compliant, robust, and simple to use.
    ''' Just add the following code into your XAML:
    '''
    ''' xmlns:AVBehav="clr-namespace:Edi.View.Behavior"
    ''' ...
    '''
    ''' avalonDock:DockingManager AnchorablesSource="{Binding Tools}"
    '''                           DocumentsSource="{Binding Files}"
    '''                           ActiveContent="{Binding ActiveDocument, Mode=TwoWay, Converter={StaticResource ActiveDocumentConverter}}"
    '''                           Grid.Row="3"
    '''                           SnapsToDevicePixels="True"
    '''                AVBehav:AvalonDockLayoutSerializer.LoadLayoutCommand="{Binding LoadLayoutCommand}"
    '''                AVBehav:AvalonDockLayoutSerializer.SaveLayoutCommand="{Binding SaveLayoutCommand}"
    '''
    ''' The LoadLayoutCommand passes a reference of the AvalonDock Manager instance to load the XML layout.
    ''' The SaveLayoutCommand passes a string of the XML Layout which can be persisted by the viewmodel/model.
    '''
    ''' Both command bindings work with RoutedCommands or delegate commands (RelayCommand).
